I got a letter from the government the other day
Opened it and read it, it said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me givin' a damn, I said, never

Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like myself because I never did
I wasn't with it but just that very minute
It occurred to me, the suckers had authority

Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell
How long has it been? They got me sittin' in the state pen
I gotta get out, but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor

I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me, begin to be another one
Public enemy servin' time, they drew the line y'all
They criticize me for some crime

I got a letter, I got a letter, I got a letter
Picture me givin' a damn, I said, never
Mmm, mmm, mmm
It occurred to me, the suckers had authority

Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell
How long has it been? They got me sittin' in the state pen
I gotta get out, but that thought was thought before

I'm not a fugitive on the run
I'm not a fugitive on the run

Many switch in, switch on, switch off
Many switch in, switch on, switch off
Many switch in, switch on, switch off
Many switch in, switch on, switch off
Many switch in, switch on, switch off

Nevertheless they could not understand
I am a black man and I could never be a veteran
On the strength of situations, I'm real
I got a raw deal, so I'm lookin' for the steel, looking for the steel
